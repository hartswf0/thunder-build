# ThunderBuild

ThunderBuild is a powerful web-based 3D construction and design tool that enables users to create, manipulate, and visualize 3D structures in real-time. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an intuitive interface for architectural and construction planning.

## Core Features

- **3D Object Manipulation**
  - Create basic 3D shapes (cubes, cylinders, etc.)
  - Move, rotate, and scale objects with precision
  - Snap-to-grid functionality for accurate placement
  - Transform controls for intuitive object manipulation

- **Measurement System**
  - Grid-based measurement system
  - Precise object dimensioning
  - Real-world scale reference

- **Interface Controls**
  - Camera controls: orbit, pan, and zoom
  - Grid toggle for reference
  - Context menu for quick actions
  - Properties panel for object details

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use left-click to select objects
3. Use right-click to open the context menu
4. Camera Controls:
   - Left mouse button: Rotate view
   - Right mouse button: Pan view
   - Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out

## Controls

- **Object Selection**: Left-click on an object
- **Camera Movement**: 
  - Orbit: Left mouse button + drag
  - Pan: Right mouse button + drag
  - Zoom: Mouse wheel
- **Object Manipulation**:
  - Move: Drag the colored axes
  - Rotate: Use the rotation gizmo
  - Scale: Use the scale handles
- **Grid**: Toggle grid visibility for reference

## Technical Details
